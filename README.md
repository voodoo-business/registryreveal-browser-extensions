## 🔍 What It Does

Have you ever typed a domain name into your browser’s address bar to see if it exists? When a domain fails to resolve, you’re often left copying and pasting that domain into a registrar's search tool (AKA domain checking tool).

**Registry Reveal cuts out the middle step.** If the domain doesn’t resolve, our extension automatically detects the DNS error and redirects you to our lightning-fast domain availability checker.

With **one simple action**, you'll know:

- ✅ If the domain is available to register
- ✅ If the domain is pending delete or in registry redemption (Potentially available soon)
- ❌ If it's already taken
- 💤 if it's simply parked or inactive

This makes it perfect for:

- Domain investors
- Web developers
- SEO professionals
- Startups and entrepreneurs
- Anyone brainstorming domain names
